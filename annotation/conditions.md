# Conditions

When you using CDP 365, these conditions usually appear throughout system features

## Logical operator&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2539).png>)

| Operator | Description                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AND      | Data will be retrieved when all the matching conditions are met   |
| OR       | Data will be retrieved when one of the conditions combined is met |

> **Example**: Get a list of users who have phone numbers and email address information  &#x20;
>
> * **Combined with AND:** requires the user to have both phone numbers and email address, missing 1 of the 2 will not satisfy the condition
> * **Combined with OR**: user only has phone numbers or email address will satisfy the condition&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: **CDP 365** supports maximum&#x20;

* 20 OR conditions in each set
* 20 AND conditions in one OR condition
