# System delivery

## EVENT LIST

By default, the 'System delivery' source is set up to incorporate the following events.

<table><thead><tr><th width="258">Event name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unsubscribed segment</td><td><p>We offer a feature for email templates that enables users to add an 'Unsubscribe' block.</p><p></p><p>'Unsubscribed segment' event is triggered when readers click the 'Unsubscribe' button in emails sent to them. Subsequently, these readers are collected into a segment for servicing marketing campaigns.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Entered control group</td><td>'Control group' is a crucial element in the marketing domain, and we enable users to activate this feature within the 'A/B Split' node.<br><br>'Entered control group' event is triggered when audiences enter the 'Control group' branch. Subsequently, users can segment these audiences and launch suitable campaigns.</td></tr><tr><td>Destination frequency capping</td><td>In every destination, we offer a 'Frequency capping' feature to control the number of messages delivered.<br><br>'Destination frequency capping' event is triggered when a destination reaches its delivery limit (limit on user or journey).</td></tr><tr><td>Invalid request tracked</td><td>We always encourage users to connect with destination vendors (such as G Suite email, Mailchimp, etc.) that they are familiar with. However, each vendor has its own distinct policy, and a request is only processed when it complies with their guidelines (such as required fields, correct formatting, etc.).<br><br>'Invalid request tracked' event is triggered when a request to a third-party vendor fails to adhere to their rules.</td></tr><tr><td>Hard bounce tracked</td><td>'Hard bounce tracked' event triggered when our system receives 'hard bounce error message' responses from third-party vendors. For example:<br><br>Email channel: hard bounces typically result from issues such as invalid email addresses, domain name errors, or recipient mail server issues.<br><br>SMS channel: sending an SMS to a phone number that is no longer in use or has been deactivated.</td></tr><tr><td>Soft bounce tracked</td><td>'Soft bounce tracked' event triggered when our system receives 'soft bounce error message' responses from third-party vendors. For example:<br><br>Email channel: a soft bounce refers to a temporary failure in delivering an email to a recipient's address. It occurs when the recipient's mailbox is full, their server is temporarily down, or there is a message size issue.<br><br>SMS channel: sending an SMS to a phone number that is temporarily unreachable due to network congestion.</td></tr><tr><td>BO info updated by journey</td><td>'Update info' node enables users to update audience data to two data objects, including 'customer' and 'visitor,' when these audiences meet specific conditions.<br><br>'BO info updated by journey' event is triggered when an audience's property is updated to the data object.</td></tr><tr><td>3rd campaign tracking</td><td>For example, when a request is sent from CDP 365 to an SMS vendor, the vendor is expected to deliver the message 'Welcome to the store' to Customer A. After sending the message, the vendor forwards a response to CDP 365 regarding the status of the delivery.<br><br>'3rd campaign tracking' event is triggered when a vendor returns a response about the status of a message.</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery system error</td><td>When our system fails to deliver a message to an audience, 'Delivery system error' event is triggered.<br><br>We rely on this signal to display a warning notification. Additionally, we may activate a suitable campaign to retarget the audience group.</td></tr><tr><td>Ads might be viewed</td><td>For example, if a user configures a 'Welcome' popup to appear when an audience accesses the website for the first time.<br><br>'Ads might be viewed' is utilized to inform CDP 365 when an audience engages with the popup by viewing it.</td></tr><tr><td>Ads delivered (impression)</td><td>Similarly to the above use case, 'Ads delivered' is used to notify CDP 365 when the popup is successfully delivered to an audience.</td></tr><tr><td>Ads clicked</td><td>Following the same pattern as the previous use case, 'Ads clicked' event is used to notify CDP 365 when an audience interacts with the popup by clicking on it.</td></tr><tr><td>Request update segment</td><td>'Update segment' node enables users to push an audience group that meets specific conditions to a segment for retargeting purposes.<br><br>'Request update segment' event is triggered when an audience is updated to a segment.</td></tr><tr><td>Missing receiver tracking</td><td>In order to send a message successfully, we require a targeted audience, content, and the receiver's address (phone number, email, etc.).<br><br>'Missing receiver tracking' event is triggered when a message is configured to be sent to an audience, but this audience lacks information about the receiver's address.</td></tr><tr><td>Story frequency capping</td><td>If 'Destination frequency capping' event is triggered when a destination reaches its delivery limit, 'Story frequency capping' event is triggered when an audience exceeds the limit of times they enter a customer journey targeted to them.</td></tr></tbody></table>
