# About reports

**Insights** reports tell stories with data. These stories can persuade, provide insights, validate decisions, or argue for a change of course. Good reports help you find actionable information quickly and easily. This article provides a quick overview of Insights reports for viewers: consumers of reports. The rest of the articles in this topic are intended for report editors and creators.

## Change the date range (N)

Charts have a different default date ranges, depending on the data source they are based on. The report's author might include a Date Range control, giving you the option of displaying a different date range. If present, the Date Range control applies to the entire report. All of the charts, including those with date comparisons, will now respect the new date range you've set.

To change the date range:

1. View the report.
2. Click the **Date Range** dropdown.
3. Use one of the preset date options, such as **Last week**, **Yesterday**, or **Last month**, or use the calendar to select your beginning and ending dates.
4. Click **Apply**.

_Date Range controls are optional objects that can be included by the report author. The control will often (but not always) be in the report header._

## Refine your view

Reports can include [**Filters**](../filter-your-data/about-filters.md) that restrict the data being shown in the Report.

There are two types of filters:&#x20;

* The filter applies to a chart ([Bar Chart Filter](../filter-your-data/create-edit-and-manage-filters.md)).
* The filter applies to charts of a data source ([Interactions](../make-reports-interactive/add-chart-interaction-filters.md)).
