## Add charts to the report

A chart visualizes your data. **Insights** come with a number of preconfigured charts, which you can add to your report and then customize as needed. To learn more about specific charts, see the [chart references](broken-reference).

To add a chart to the current page:

1. Edit your report.
2. Navigate to the page that will contain the chart.
3. In the tool bar, click **Add a chart** ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc_7Z1z0_YgedSPxQ1-4_-sWzg1JDU2Zko9GnJGyXEVGEEkV-vKy_dSjalo64cI8eEjGSsvp_vfJk16sFjlHnM5gUVPepnR0nebzy8pk2_6ZhI7cpt4HhReRz42j9yAT-rpqrHaFJ9uk7autS8ioA_atr5g?key=c3wH37wA9h3h9ApPDZt-ng)

## Add fields to a chart

1. Select a chart or control.
2. Make sure the DATA tab is selected.
3. On the right, browse or search in the _Available Fields_ list.
4. Then drag the new field into an empty slot of the appropriate type (dimension or metric).

## Replace fields in a chart

1. Select a chart or control.
2. Make sure the DATA tab is selected.
3. On the right, browse or search in the _Available Fields_ list.
4. Drag the new field on top of an existing field.

## Remove fields from a chart

1. Select a chart or control.
2. Make sure the DATA tab is selected.
3. Hover over the field you want to remove.
4. To the right of the field name, click ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1664).png>).

## Snap to grid

When you place new objects on the canvas, or move them with the mouse or keyboard, they "snap to grid." You can nudge components using the mouse or arrow keys and holding down the Shift key. This lets you position elements outside of the grid lines.

You can change the grid size in the [report layout options](broken-reference).

Learn more about [arranging and grouping components on the page](broken-reference).

## Switch chart type

Use the chart icons at the top of the properties panel to switch between chart types. This lets you see how your data looks using different visualization techniques. **Insights** adjust the default dimensions and metrics to best suit the selected chart type. Any customizations you have made to the chart, including adding or changing dimensions and metrics, style options, filters, or segments are preserved so you can switch back to the originally selected chart.

## Edit chart properties

Use the component properties panel on the right to configure the chart's data and style options. This panel appears whenever you have a component selected (otherwise, you will see the Layout and Theme panel).

The properties panel usually has two tabs. The _DATA_ is where you configure the dimensions and metrics displayed in a chart or used by a control. This is also where you set other data-related options, like sort order, default date range, and filters.

The _STYLE_ tab lets you control the appearance of the component, including font and background colors, border shadow, axes labels, and more

Shapes and text boxes don't have data options, so their property panels only have a _STYLE_ tab.

## Add other components to the report

Use the toolbar icons or the **Insert** menu to add other components to the current page. Besides charts, you can add the following kinds of components to your reports:

* **Interactive components**, such as dimensions filters, date range controls, and the data control, allow viewers to customize the data displayed in your reports. Learn how to [make reports interactive](broken-reference).
* **Design components**, such as images, text boxes, rectangles, lines, and circles, add stylistic elements, letting you brand your reports and make them visually appealing. Learn more about [adding design components](broken-reference).
* **Embedded external content**, such videos and external websites, let you create reports that integrate a wide variety of content. Learn more about [embedding external content](broken-reference).
