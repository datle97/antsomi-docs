# Arrange and distribute components

ou can access all of these options by right-clicking (or control-clicking) a component or group of components.

### Order options

The order options control how objects appear in front of or behind other object.

**Bring to front**—causes the selected component(s) to appear in front of all the other components on the page.

**Send to back**—causes the selected component(s) to appear behind all the other components on the page.

### Make Report-Level / Make Page-Level

When you first create a component (i.e., a chart, text box, shape, or image), it only exists in the page in which you create it. You can have a component appear on every page in a report by making it _report-level_.

To reverse this, use the Make Page-Level option (which only appears for report-level components). This makes a report-level component local to the current page.
