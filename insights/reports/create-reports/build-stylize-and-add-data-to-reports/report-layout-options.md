# Report layout options

You can control the way your report appears on the viewer's screen using the options in the _Layout_ tab of the _Theme and Layout_ panel.

The _Theme and Layout_ panel appears when no report components are selected. You can display this panel at any time by clicking **Theme and Layout** in the toolbar. Many of the options described here are also found in the **View** menu.
