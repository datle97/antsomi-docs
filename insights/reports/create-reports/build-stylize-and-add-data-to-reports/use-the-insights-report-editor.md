# Use the Insights Report Editor

This article explains the basic workings of Insights report editor, the tool you use to build your reports and dashboards. You must be signed into Insights to use the editor.

### Access the report editor

You access the editor by creating a new report, or editing an existing report.

### The properties panel <a href="#the-properties-panel" id="the-properties-panel"></a>

Learn how to configure your Insights reports using the new and improved properties panel. Add, change, and reorder dimensions and metrics. Change field names, aggregations, and apply analytical functions. All within the report editor: no need to edit your data source.

The _Properties_ panel appears on the right side of the report editor. This is where you configure settings for everything that appears in your reports.

There are essentially 3 types of properties panels:

* The _Layout and Theme_ properties panel appears as the default, when nothing is selected on the canvas.
* The component properties panel appears when you select one.

### Work with multiple components at once

You can work with multiple components at the same time. Just select the components you want to work with (known as "multi selecting"), then perform an action to apply to all the selected items. For example, you can resize several charts at once, as shown below:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1946).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Other multi select actions include editing shared properties, aligning, copying, and deleting
