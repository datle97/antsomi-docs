Connecting to your data involves two components that work together:

* **Connectors** connect **Insights** to your underlying data. Connecting to your data creates a _data source_ in **Insights**.
* **Data sources** represent a particular instance of a connector. Data sources let you configure the fields and options provided by the connector used to create that connection instance. In addition, the data source gives you a secure way to share information and insights with report viewers who may not be able to directly access the underlying data.
