# Dimension

Dimensions are categories of information. The values contained in those categories are typically names, descriptions or other characteristics of that data.

For example, if you are reporting on website traffic, your data likely contains dimensions like _Browser_, _Landing page_ and _Campaign._ The values for these dimensions will contain things like `Chrome`, or `/home,` or `Summer Sale`. Dimensions for geographic data would include _Continent_, _Country_, _Latitude_, and _Longitude_. The values for these dimensions will contain things like `North America`, `United States`, `36.985891`, and `-121.965528`. Dimensions also include unaggregated numbers, such as price.
