# Edit mode

Edit mode gives you access to the[ report editor](broken-reference), which lets you add, remove, and style components.&#x20;

**Switch from view mode to edit mode:**

* Click the **Edit** toggle on the far right of the toolbar.

You must have edit permission to see the Edit toggle. This means you either need to have created the report or the creator must have shared the report with you with the edit permission.
