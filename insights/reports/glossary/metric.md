# Metric

Metrics are aggregations that come from the underlying data set, or are the result of implicitly or explicitly applying an aggregation function, such as COUNT(), SUM(), or AVG(). The metric itself has no defined set of values, so you cannot group by it, as you can with a [dimension](broken-reference).
