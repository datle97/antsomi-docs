# Report

Reports let you visualize your data, gain insights, and share those insights with others. You can share reports with other people and let them just view the data, or give them edit access so they can change the report structure. Reports can consist of multiple pages, charts and other components, such as controls, text areas, shapes, and images.

Reports derive their data from one or more [data sources.](broken-reference)
