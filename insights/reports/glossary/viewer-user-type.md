# Viewer (user type)

Viewers have **Can View** permission to the reports and data sources that have been shared with them. View permission allows you to interact with a report or view the data source structure, but not make any modifications. Viewers can share the report or data source with other people, but only with **Can View** permission. This can be prevented by Editors and Owners.
