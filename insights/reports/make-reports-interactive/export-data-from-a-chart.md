# Export data from a chart

You can use Insights to gain insights about your data, then export that data for use in other tools.

### To export data from a chart <a href="#to-export-data-from-a-chart" id="to-export-data-from-a-chart"></a>

1. View the report.
2. Hover over the chart you wish to export.
3. Right-click on the chart or click <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kz1M6nAGoh2SvZ44eaZ_c1scIotCBl_qJzei-gV6Q3RwuLm21XVaqfQMUK2bgzxmoLU=w36-h36" alt="More options." data-size="line"> and select export options:

* **Download file as Excel** creates a comma separated text file where non-ASCII characters are encoded properly for use in Excelâ„¢.
* **Export to Google Sheets** sends your data directly to Sheets.

#### Can't see the <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kz1M6nAGoh2SvZ44eaZ_c1scIotCBl_qJzei-gV6Q3RwuLm21XVaqfQMUK2bgzxmoLU=w36-h36" alt="More options." data-size="line"> menu?

Sometimes other components on the page can obscure the <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kz1M6nAGoh2SvZ44eaZ_c1scIotCBl_qJzei-gV6Q3RwuLm21XVaqfQMUK2bgzxmoLU=w36-h36" alt="More options." data-size="line"> menu. If you can edit the report, try increasing the space around your charts.

It's also possible the owner of the report has prevented exporting the data (see below).

### How data export works <a href="#how-data-export-works" id="how-data-export-works"></a>

Data export saves the information from a chart to the file format you select. (Data export doesn't save an image of the chart, just its data.)

Data export is available in view mode. Data export works on an individual chart basis. Only the data available to you in that chart is exported. Any filters or date range controls currently in place are also applied to the exported data. This lets you use the Insight report to fine-tune your data before exporting it.

#### Export from tables

You can control how much data to export from a table using the **Show pagination** option, located in the table's _STYLE_ tab, and the **Rows per page** option, located in the _DATA_ tab.

* When **Show pagination** is enabled, all data in the table is exported. The number of rows per page has no effect on the amount of data exported.
* When **Show pagination** is disabled, only the number of rows shown in the table are exported.

### Limits of exporting data from a chart <a href="#limits" id="limits"></a>

You can export up to 10,000 rows of data from a chart. If the number is more than 10,000 Insights will suggest emailing the exported data to you.
