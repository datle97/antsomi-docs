# Third-party campaigns

## Introduction

Third-party campaigns allow users to create campaigns on external systems directly from CDP 365. Currently, this feature is available exclusively for the SMS channel.

## Advertising SMS FPT

Advertising SMS FPT is the first type of campaign weâ€™ve launched. Specifically, you can create a new SMS campaign to send promotional messages directly to customers via their phone numbers.

Hover over the 'Advertising SMS FPT' card and click **Create Campaign** to launch a new third-party campaign.

This is the user interface for creating a new third-party campaign using the 'Advertising SMS FPT' type.
