<table><thead><tr><th width="157">Status</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Activate</td><td>It activates the designed journeys</td></tr><tr><td>Pause</td><td>It uses for pausing. After pausing, the journey will resume receiving new audiences. Audiences that have already entered the journey will be placed in the queue waiting for the next node</td></tr><tr><td>Freeze</td><td>It uses for freezing the journey. Once frozen, the journey will stop receiving new audiences. Audiences that have already entered the journey will be queued for the next node</td></tr><tr><td>Reactivated</td><td>It uses for reactivating the journey</td></tr><tr><td>Close</td><td>It uses for closing the journey. Once closed, the journey will stop receiving new audiences. Audiences that have entered the journey will be processed until the end of the flow</td></tr><tr><td>Abort</td><td>It uses for aborting the journey </td></tr></tbody></table>

The status of a journey could be changed in the journey settings.

## Stop allocating campaign

CDP 365 stops allocating the branch content of journey or the variant content by switching the status from ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1101).png>)to ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2377).png>).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/2023-09-13_15-48-18.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Stop allocating campaigns</p></figcaption></figure>

Moreover, the journey can also stop allocating content in the Journey settings.

## Action History or Schedule History

These 2 tabs record the information about times that a Journey executed.&#x20;

The trigger type of a Journey will decide which of these 2 tabs it has.&#x20;

* If the journey is triggered by the action-based trigger, it would have Action History tab.
* If the journey is triggered by the schedule trigger, it would have Schedule History tab.

### Action History

Every time an audience enters a journey by performing an event,  a Process ID is created. Action History manages the data about these Process IDs.&#x20;

In the tab, it provides:

* Process ID&#x20;
* Process type is the trigger type of the journey&#x20;
* Visitor ID and Customer ID is the IDs of the audience who entered the journey&#x20;
* Resumed process ID is the ID of a process that was resumed&#x20;
* Journey version is the version which the audience entered
* State is the status of process ID, etc

<details>

<summary>State</summary>

* Waiting: waiting (eg: delay, waiting for event, ..)

- Completed: for Update Info node, Update Segment

* End: before the end node there is no Destination/ Update Segment/ Update Info

- Missing receiver: audience missed information for the delivery (phone/email)

* Violate destination frequency capping: blocked by destination FC

- Violate trigger frequency capping: blocked by trigger FC

* Sent content error: delivery sent error content

- Build content error: build content error

* Exit journey: stop before reaching the destination

- Delivered: 3rd response was sent successfully

* Bounce & Error: 3rd response bound & error

- Paused: variant/campaign of the destination node is off

</details>

### Schedule history

Every time an audience enters a journey during the time period set in the Trigger node,  a Process ID is created. Schedule history manages the data about these Process IDs.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/schedule.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



### Details of a process ID

If you a process ID, the screen direct you to the details of that process ID.&#x20;

The details are divided into two tabs

* Diagram shows the nodes which the audience has been and the status of each node
* Detail shows the details of each node&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2527).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Details of a process ID</p></figcaption></figure>

The chart section in the detail tab helps users have a more intuitive view of the results of the processes.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1302).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are 2 chart type: line chart and score card.

#### Line chart:

1. To show line chart, click on Chart type, select Line chart.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (601).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Select metric to show value in the chart. Metrics that can be chosen are the states of the process ID

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1143).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Click on adjust to choose how to divide the points on the chart

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1725).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. To show scorecard, click ch·ªçn Chart type and select Scorecard.
2. Click on + Add Scorecard to choose metric show in chart. Metrics that can be chosen are the states of the process ID

A process ID could be resumed following these steps&#x20;

* Go to Action/ Schedule History&#x20;
* Select the cell&#x20;
* Click EDIT
* Select a Resume type

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (690).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Resume </p></figcaption></figure>

### Resume type

There are three types of resume for a process of a journey

1. Resume whole process: the process selected is resumed all nodes that the audience went through from the trigger node to the destination node. Not allow selecting a node to be resumed.
2. Resume from node: select a node to be resumed, and the journey is resumed. The resumed journey
   * Starts from the trigger node
   * Goes through the nodes required, which are before the selected node
   * Ends at a destination node.
3.  Resume specific node: select at least a node to be resumed, and the journey is resumed.&#x20;

    The resumed journey

    * Starts from the trigger node
    * Goes through the nodes required, which are before the selected node.
    * Ends at the selected node.
