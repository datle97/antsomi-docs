# Link Management

## ALL VENDOR MANAGEMENT

The app includes one tab: Vendors. It shows the list of the your account on CDP 365 on link shortener platform.&#x20;

There will always be a Default Internal Vendor Account which allows you to [create your own Brand Account](https://docs.antsomi.com/cdp-365-user-guide-en/use-cases/marketing-hub/how-to-create-branded-domain-in-link-management) or using Antsomi domain (Eg: _ants.ly_, _abc.com_, etc)

### Account Status

* Active: The account is being used to create short links
* Paused: The account has been paused, you could not create short link from this account
* Removed: The account has been deleted. (Accounts having this status will not be displayed on the Data table. You could use Filter to take it out.) &#x20;

### Primary Account

* There is ONLY ONE primary account. This account will be used to generate the short link in [Customer Journey](https://docs.antsomi.com/cdp-365-user-guide-en/use-cases/marketing-hub/how-to-create-branded-domain-in-link-management#extension).
* If you turn off the account which is used in the Customer Journey, Default Internal Vendor Account will be automatically used instead. In other word, from the moment your account is turned off, the short links created in the future will be have <mark style="color:blue;">ants.ly</mark> domain.
