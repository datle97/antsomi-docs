#### Customize Wheel Sections

The settings have

* ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (986).png>) or <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1202).png" alt="" data-size="original">: adding or deleting sections
* Label: naming sections
* Internal code: is the name managed by the system of CDP 365 which is automatically generated by Label
* Can Win and Win Chance (%): Managing the win probability of each section. Can Win must turn on if the section can be won.
* Pool and Coupon code: Managing the promotion pool is used by each section. Pool must turn on if the section uses a promotion pool to send out prizes.
* Limit Spinning: Managing the number of win times of each section. It includes
  * Out of code is available if Pool is on. The setting means audiences stop winning the section when the codes in the selected promotion run out.
  * Set value means audiences stop winning the section when reaching the number of winning times set. For example, if the set value is 1, then all audiences spinning the wheel can win the section only one time. If selecting Set value, then set
    * Capping level: has Journey, Campaign, and Variant.&#x20;
    * Frequency: includes This Hour, This Day, This Week, This Month, and Lifetime. Lifetime means the whole time that a journey is active.
    * The requirement of the campaign is the section can win 2 times in the journey. Then Limit Spinning selects Set value - 2, Capping Level selects Journey, and Frequency selects Lifetime.
  * Unlimited means audiences can win the section unlimitedly.

For example, the wheel sends out 2 TVs, 10 backpacks, 20 glasses of water, 1,000 20% off codes, and an unlimited number of 10K discount codes. Set Win chance is 10%, 15%, 25%, 20%, and 30% respectively. Limit Spinning is 2, 10, 20, 1,000, and Unlimited respectively.

_**Notes**: Limit Spinning is different from Can Win and Win Chance. Can Win allows the audience would win the section at the probability of winning set in Win Chance. Limit Spinning allows setting the actual number of times that audiences would win the section._
