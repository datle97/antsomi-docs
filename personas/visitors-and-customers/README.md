## AUDIENCE PROFILE

Audience profile is classified into Visitor profile and Customer profile.&#x20;

Not only CDP 365 provides a 365-degree picture of a visitor or a customer but also indicates the relationship between a customer profile and visitor profiles which represents a unique user.

### **Visitor profile**

A visitor profile has an Activities tab that provides

* Visitor Information: ID, the last updated date of the audience's events, etc. &#x20;
* Identity Graph: The relationship between a customer and other visitors
* Product recommendations: The results are proposed based on the events of the visitor or the customer
* Timeline: Detailed events that the visitor or the customer has taken
* Searches: Keywords that the visitor or the customer has searched on domains.

* Devices
