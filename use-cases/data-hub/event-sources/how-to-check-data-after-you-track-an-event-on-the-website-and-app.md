# How to check data after you track an event on the website and app?

To ensure accurate event tracking and data recording for Visitors or Customers, follow these steps: [visit the website](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#visit-the-website), [execute the desired action](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#execute-the-desired-action) to trigger the intendedly-checked [event](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#check-the-event), and then [access CDP 365](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#access-cdp-365) to examine [the event tracking traffic](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#examine-the-event-tracking-log) and [recorded data](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#examine-the-recorded-data).

### Let's take **the '**<mark style="color:red;">**View page**</mark>**' event on the website as an example**.

## VISIT THE WEBSITE

### Execute the desired action

To successfully test the event, it is essential to identify the specific action that triggers it.

Take that action!

Whenever a page is loaded, the 'View page' event is triggered, which implies that you will have a 'View page' event recorded for every instance of viewing any page.

The desired action is '**view**' any page on the website.

### Check the event

Once you have performed the desired action, the event will be triggered, and you can now open the **'Inspector' or 'Inspect' tool** on your desktop by clicking the right-hand mouse.

The panel will pop up on your screen.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1822).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Inspector panel</p></figcaption></figure>

To locate the CDP 365 events, please proceed to open the '**Network**' tab and apply a filter using the keyword '**event?**'.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (820).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Filter out the CDP 365 events</p></figcaption></figure>

By clicking on the event name, you can access the event details, where you will **find the elements of the event documented in the API documentation**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (985).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Event Name</p></figcaption></figure>

Navigate to the **Payload** section, where you will discover the event log containing the event category (ec) and event action (ea) fields. These fields correspond to the **Event category** and **Event Action** documented **in the API documentation** and the settings within CDP 365.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (616).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The details of 'View page' event</p></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>More information of the Payload section</summary>

Within the Payload section, you can find various pieces of information, such as **customer details** (depending on the events), **visitor information**, **product data** (depending on the events), your CDP 365 portal ID, and **other event attributes that capture the desired data**.

</details>

#### An example of checking the 'View page' event

This is the **code sample** documented in your API documentation.

```
ec: pageview
ea: view
en: 
ev: 0
dims: {"customers":{"customer_id":"abedjjojo12313498uijaj"}}
portal_id: 23492034809
prop_id: 2918309183049
rec: 1
client_id: 0.1123082348
log_type: event
uid: 10502123132
aid: 10502111231
cvar: {"page_type":"category","page_category":"Dép thời trang","pv_id":"",
"session_id":0,"prop_id":2918309183049,"visitor_type":"returning","is_webview":false,
"location_url":"https://abcdef.com/main-cate-page/sub-cate-page.html?page=1",
"referrer_url":"https://abcdef.com/","click_bc":"1239308095830942",
"utm_source":"google.com","utm_medium":"referrer","utm_type":"referrer",
"atm_source":"accesstrade","atm_type":"on_session",
"identify_type":"predict","page_title":"Sub cate page"}
```

You verify the event that was triggered on your '**Homepage**'.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1614).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The 'View page' event fired at Homepage</p></figcaption></figure>

In the event details, you can find

1. **Dims**: encompass the customer data, which serves as an optional event element. This element is only available if CDP 365 can detect the identifying information of the visitor.
2. **Portal\_id**: The ID assigned to your CDP 365 portal, which aids Antsomi in effectively managing our clients.
3. **Prop\_id**: The ID associated with your CDP 365 source, facilitating efficient source management on your part.
4. **UID**: The Visitor ID in CDP 365 is generated by utilizing a browser cookie.
5. **Page type** and **Page category** are two crucial event attributes that identify the specific pages you are currently on. These attributes play a significant role in verifying the accuracy of event tracking. In the image, you will find the keyword 'Home' used as the page type and page category.&#x20;
6. Other event attributes can be customized based on your specific data requirements.&#x20;

_Notes: Each event element is crucial, and if any element records incorrect data compared to what you observe on the screen, it indicates a failure in event tracking._&#x20;

You verify the event that was triggered on your '**Fashion Shoes page**'.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2487).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The 'View page' event fired at a page category</p></figcaption></figure>

For instance, when the 'View page' event is triggered within a specific page category, it records the keyword 'category' for the page type and 'Dép thời trang' ('Fashion shoes') as the page category.

## ACCESS CDP 365

To examine the event tracking data in CDP 365, navigate to the **Event Sources** section.

Log into the **CDP 365** system. Hover your mouse over **Data** on the left hand side menu → Choose **Event Sources.**

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3084).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Choose the source that corresponds to the event occurrence, which aligns with the prop\_id you observed in the event details on the website.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3085).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To verify the prop\_id, navigate to the "Setting" tab.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3086).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>prop_id</p></figcaption></figure>

### Examine the event tracking log

To confirm the event details obtained from the website, navigate to the 'Events' tab and choose a specific event for verification.

Let's get back to the 'View page' event.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3087).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From this panel, you will find event logs recorded from the 'Website' source specifically for the 'View page' event within the last 6 hours.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3088).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To locate your traffic, filter the '**uid**' obtained from your website.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3101).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click on an event log to access its detailed information.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3091).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Compare the information in the event log with the details provided on your website. If they match, the event tracking works properly.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3100).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Examine the user activities&#x20;

Once we have ensured correct event tracking in CDP 365, the next step is to verify whether the data is appropriately updated for the respective Visitor and Customer in CDP 365.

First, check the **Visitor profile** and apply a filter using the '**uid**' to locate the specific profile.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3093).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Apply a filter to your **User ID (uid)** in order to narrow down the results.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3094).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Click on the User ID to access the Visitor profile

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3095).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Review the activities recorded in the Visitor Profile. If the action and date/time of event occurrence are accurately recorded, it indicates that the data update is functioning correctly.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3105).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, check the **Customer profile** and apply a filter using the '**customer id**' to locate the specific profile. The checking can only occur if the customer ID is available.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3102).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Review the activities recorded in the **Customer Profile**. If the action and date/time of event occurrence are accurately recorded, it indicates that the data update is functioning correctly.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3099).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### We go to check the **'**<mark style="color:red;">**View product**</mark>**' event**.

For other event checks, the steps will be similar to the process of checking the 'View page' event.

This is the **code sample** documented in your API documentation.

## CHECK THE EVENT TRACKING ON YOUR <mark style="color:red;">APP</mark>

The process of checking event tracking on the app is similar to that on the website.

One step that differentiates between the two platforms is how you can find your event log in CDP 365.&#x20;

To ensure accurate event tracking and data recording for Visitors or Customers, follow these steps:&#x20;

* **Step 1**: visit the app
* **Step 2**: [execute the desired action](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#execute-the-desired-action) to trigger the intendedly-checked [event](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#check-the-event)

_Note: During this step, it's important to note that you won't have access to the Inspector tool to directly review the event element. Unlike the website environment where you can utilize browser tools like the Inspector to examine event details, this capability is not available when working with the app._

* **Step 3**: [access CDP 365](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#access-cdp-365) to examine [the event tracking traffic](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#examine-the-event-tracking-log) and [recorded data](how-to-check-data-after-you-track-an-event-on-the-website-and-app.md#examine-the-recorded-data).

_Note: In CDP 365, the event log can be filtered based on your login information (for the purchase event) or your customer ID (for other events), which may vary depending on the required login details. This typically includes either a phone number or an email address associated with your account._

_To locate your customer ID, access the Customer Business Object in CDP 365 and filter by your login information._
